**Abstract**:

* **Context**: This study examines the relationship between classroom occupancy and environmental parameters like CO2, PM1, PM2.5, PM10, Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Acoustics.
* **Methodology**: Data was collected in real-time using a custom device, which helped establish relationships among primary features for developing accurate occupancy prediction models.
* **Results**: The study achieved an occupancy estimation accuracy ranging from 91% to 99% using multiple environmental sensor data.
